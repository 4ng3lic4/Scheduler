## Usage
1.-Open the  daily planner to create a schedule.  The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar for quick reference of what day it currently is.

2.-Scroll down to see timeblocks for standard business hours

3.-Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

4.-Click into a timeblock to enter an event

5.-Click on the save button for that timeblock to save the event.
